# JS30 Sticky Nav
Exercise 24 in WesBos' JavaScript30 tutorials.

Being into UI/UX I especially love these layout days!  I have come across the stickyNav concept in libraries like Bootstrap and MaterializeCSS including the "collapse" feature that acts similar to what we did with the logo here. However I have hadn't yet seen customization of it before, doing it this way without a library allows us to 100% customize what comes in or animates where and how, without having to override pre-existing default behaviors such as the logo positioning. 

For my bonus I used FlexBox (as it was already in place) to enable a sideNav on scroll and some css to let the user know which menu item they are on. I also added some JS so that the page content would go from 45% maxWidth to 50% lining it up flush with the 25% maxWidth of the sideNav. This could have been done with the .fixed-nav .site-wrap CSS selector as well but I wanted to demonstrate CSS & JS.
